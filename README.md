# Mixing Desk Trainer

A modern mixing panel has a lot of buttons and dials, and it can be hard to figure out what they all do. A live performance and even rehearsals are not the best time to play around, so it can be hard to find a place to practice.

This repo intends to provide training resources for teaching people to use a modern mixing desk including EQing, mixing multiple channels etc. It won't provide
a complete simulation of the desk, but should be adequate to train the skills for day-to-day running of a desk. The desk is roughly based on an Allen & Heath QU-16
as that is what I have access to.

## Current State:

You can:

- Simulate EQing a single channel
- Use custom audio or some preset samples

## Use it?

(Link to come when I've done an deployment)

## Development?
This is done with npm/vite/react/typescript If more people start developing on this project I'll set up stylechecking/linting etc.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
